Background
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OCRopus is a state-of-the-art document analysis and OCR system, featuring
    * pluggable layout analysis,
    * pluggable character recognition,
    * statistical natural language modeling and
    * multi-lingual capabilities.
OCRopus development is sponsored by Google and is initially intended for
high-throughput, high-volume document conversion efforts. We expect that
it will also be an excellent OCR system for many other applications.

OCRopus is mainly based on research projects of Thomas Breuel and the Image
Understanding and Pattern Recognition (IUPR) group of the German Research
Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI) located in Kaiserslautern, Germany.

OCRopus uses data structures and algorithms from iulib - the open source 
Image Understanding Library (http://code.google.com/p/iulib/) which has
been part of OCRopus until June 2008.
