Required and Recommended Software

iulib
_____

(http://code.google.com/p/iulib)

OCRopus uses data structures and algorithms from iulib - the open source 
Image Understanding Library which has been part of OCRopus until June 2008.
Please install iulib and all dependencies (libpng-dev etc.) first.


tesseract
_________

It is a good idea to install Tesseract also, although it's technically possible
to compile OCRopus without it. You can either use a release, which is 2.03 at
the moment of writing this, or check out an SVN version. We found revision 193
to work.

For an SVN checkout, try something like this:

    svn co http://tesseract-ocr.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ tesseract-ocr
    cd tesseract-ocr
    ./configure    # CXXFLAGS="-fPIC -O2" ./configure if you want Python later
    make
    sudo make install                                # installs in /usr/local

The 2.03 release of Tesseract has a bug. We have a patch for it, it's called
tesseract-2.03-patch.diff and located in the top-level OCRopus directory.
So the commands to install Tesseract 2.03 might look like this:

    wget http://tesseract-ocr.googlecode.com/files/tesseract-2.03.tar.gz
    tar xzf tesseract-2.03.tar.gz
    cd tesseract-2.03
    wget http://tesseract-ocr.googlecode.com/files/tesseract-2.00.eng.tar.gz
    tar xzf tesseract-2.00.eng.tar.gz             # or other language packages
    patch -p1 <../ocropus-0.3/tesseract-2.03-patch.diff     # check this path!
    ./configure    # CXXFLAGS="-fPIC -O2" ./configure if you want Python later
    make
    sudo make install                                 # installs in /usr/local

The installation will finish with an error message about having no install
target in java/ subdirectory. That's another bug in 2.03 - just ignore it.

In rare cases, Tesseract 2.03 causes crashes while performing test-tess.
This doesn't seem to affect the recognition script. In SVN, this is fixed.

After Tesseract is installed, check it by typing

    tesseract phototest.tif out
    cat out.txt

If out.txt starts with "This is a lot of 12 point text..." then Tesseract works.
Please note that if it doesn't work for you, we most likely can't really help,
but the developers of Tesseract (http://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/) most
likely can.

Building OCRopus
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After installing the needed software (see above) go to the OCRopus release
directory and run:
    ./configure
    make
    make install


You can adjust the build process with the following options to ./configure:
  --with-tesseract=...    the root of a non-default tesseract installation.
                          (default is /usr/local/)
                          Should be the same directory as was given to
                          tesseract's configure script through --prefix=
  --with-iulib=...        the root of a non-default iulib installation.
                          (default is /usr/local/)
                          Should be the same directory as was given to
                          iulib's configure script through --prefix=

  --without-fst           disable OpenFST language modelling
  --without-leptonica     disable parts depending on Leptonica
  --without-SDL           disable SDL (graphical debugging for ocroscript)

More details on configure options can be obtained with './configure --help'

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Optional Software
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This software is not mandatory, but can be useful for experimentation through Lua.

For interactive mode of ocroscript, install:
    * libeditline-dev

A library for FST handling, used in a few scripts:
    * OpenFST (http://www.openfst.org)

A nice image handling library that we use for some parts:
    * leptonica

For advanced graphical debugging, install the latest versions of the following
libs and recompile (and install) iulib:
    * libsdl-dev, libsdl-gfx-dev, libsdl-image-dev


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Building Python Extension
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

First of all, both Tesseract and OCRopus should be configured like this:
    CXXFLAGS="-fPIC -O2" ./configure

That should do the trick on a "standard" Linux. Then go to the python-binding/
subdirectory in the OCRopus release directory and use the usual Python way
of handling packages, which is
    python setup.py build
    python setup.py install

If it worked, you'll be able to "import ocropus" from Python.
