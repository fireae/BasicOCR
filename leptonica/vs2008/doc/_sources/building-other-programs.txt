====================================================
 Building programs that link with |leptonlib|
====================================================

It's simple to make projects that link with |leptonlib| since you can
just use the standard Visual Studio :menuselection:`&File --> &New -->
&Project...` wizards.  Most of the compiler and linker setting will be
dictated by your application's needs; you only have to add where to find
the header files and libraries needed with |leptonlib| and which
libraries you want to link with.

First open up your project's :gui:`Property Pages` (right-click the
project then choose :menuselection:`P&roperties` from the context
menu). Change :guilabel:`&Configuration:` to :gui:`All
Configurations`. You then have to set two items:

#. To :gui:`Configuration Properties | C/C++ | General | Additional
   Include Directories` add:
   
   `C:\\BuildFolder\\include;C:\\BuildFolder\\leptonica`

#. To :gui:`Configuration Properties | Linker | General | Additional
   Library Directories` add:

   `C:\\BuildFolder\\lib`

Of course, if you've used some other location/name instead of
`C:\\BuildFolder` for where you've put `include` and `lib` then use that
instead.

Alternatively, if you don't mind having :bi:`all` programs use these
header files and libraries, you could also globally change where Visual
Studio 2008 looks for include files and libraries by setting
:menuselection:`&Tools --> &Options...` :gui:`| Project and Settings
| VC++ Directories`.

The last step is setting :gui:`Configuration Properties | Linker | Input
| Additional Dependencies`. To link with the dynamic library Release
version of |leptonlib| add this::

  leptonlib.lib

To link with the dynamic library Debug version of |leptonlib| add this::

  leptonlibd.lib

To link with the static Release version of |leptonlib| add these::

   zlib-static-mtdll.lib
   libpng-static-mtdll.lib
   libjpeg-static-mtdll.lib
   libtiff-static-mtdll.lib
   giflib-static-mtdll.lib
   leptonlib-static-mtdll.lib

To link with the static Debug version of |leptonlib| add these::

   zlib-static-mtdll-debug.lib
   libpng-static-mtdll-debug.lib
   libjpeg-static-mtdll-debug.lib
   libtiff-static-mtdll-debug.lib
   giflib-static-mtdll-debug.lib
   leptonlib-static-mtdll-debug.lib

Any `.c` files that use Leptonica functions have to include
`allheaders.h`. If you want to use the Windows-only
``pixGetWindowsHBITMAP(PIX *pixs)`` to convert a Leptonica ``PIX`` to a
Windows ``HBITMAP`` you also have to include `leptwin.h`. It's not
automatically included by `allheaders.h`.

.. _create-tmp-directory:

Create a `\\tmp` directory
==========================

Create a `\\tmp` directory on the same drive from which you will be
running your |leptonlib| based programs. Some parts of |leptonlib|
assume they can write to `/tmp` and will mysteriously fail if this
directory doesn't exist.


.. _intellisense-and-leptonlib:

Intellisense and |leptonlib|
============================

Intellisense is a great Visual Studio feature that automatically
completes function names, shows function arguments, quickly lets you go
to a function's definition, etc. There seems to be a problem, however,
with navigating to |leptonlib| function definitions. When you right
click a function name that is part of the |leptonlib| library and choose
:menuselection:`&Go To Definition` (or press the :kbd:`F12` key),
instead of jumping to the definition it shows you the declaration in
`leptprotos.h`.

Adding the location of `leptonlib-1.xx\\src` to :menuselection:`&Tools
--> &Options` :gui:`| Projects and Solutions | VC++ Directories | Show
Directories For | Source Files` doesn't help, even though that list is
described as "Path to use when searching for source files to use for
Intellisense."

(The commercial program `Visual Assist X for Visual Studio
<http://www.wholetomato.com/>`_ has the command
:menuselection:`VAssist&X --> &Goto Implementation` (:kbd:`Alt+G`) that
does do the correct thing as long as you follow `these instructions
<http://www.wholetomato.com/products/features/goto.asp>`_.)

In order to have Visual Studio's :menuselection:`&Go To Definition`
command work correctly with |leptonlib|, you have to add its project to
your current solution:

#. Right click your solution in the Solution Explorer, and choose
   :menuselection:`A&dd --> &Existing Project...` from the context menu.

#. Select the `leptonlib-1.xx\\vs2008\\leptonlib.vcproj` file and click
   :guilabel:`&Open`.
