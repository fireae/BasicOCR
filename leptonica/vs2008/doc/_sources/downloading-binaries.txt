Downloading |leptonlib| pre-built binaries and header files for Windows
=======================================================================

The easiest way to use |leptonlib| is to download the latest version of
`leptonica-1.xx-win32-lib-include-dirs.zip`, the pre-built binary
archive, from `the Leptonica website
<http://leptonica.com/download.html#VS2008>`_.

It contains the entire `lib` and `include` directories needed to build
Windows-based programs that use the static or dynamic versions of the
|leptonlib| library (including static library versions of `zlib`,
`libpng`, `libjpeg`, `libtiff`, and `giflib`). The libraries are built
with Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 32-bit. The complete contents of the
archive can be seen :ref:`here <include-contents>`.

Unpack this file to the same directory that |leptonlib| will be in. For
example, after unpacking you should have something similar to this::
  
    BuildFolder\
      include\
      leptonlib-1.xx\
      lib\

The archive contains the latest releases of the supported image
libraries at the time |leptonlib| was released. For the current version
(Leptonica-1.66) these are:

A simple method to get the versions of |leptonlib| and its image
libraries is shown in the :ref:`Quickstart <building-hello-leptonlib>`.

If you'd like to determine the compiler options used to build these
binaries or build them yourself see :doc:`building-leptonlib` and
:doc:`building-image-libraries`.

.. note::

   Executables for the programs in the |leptonlib| `/prog` directory are
   **not** included in this archive. Follow these :doc:`instructions
   <building-prog-dir>` to build them yourself.
