==================================
 Installing gnuplot to view plots
==================================

Leptonica uses `gnuplot <http://www.gnuplot.info/>`_ to display
plots. Download the standard gnuplot Windows version (:bi:`not` the
Windows X11 version unless you know what you are doing). Besides
installing gnuplot you have to set the following environment variables:

1. Add `c:\\gnuplot\\bin` to your system's ``PATH``.

#. Create a new environment variable called ``GDFONTPATH`` and set it to
   `c:/windows/fonts`

#. Create a new environment variable called ``GNUPLOT_FONTPATH`` and
   also set it to `c:/windows/fonts`

After showing a plot, the calling program will pause until both the
plot window and gnuplot window are closed.
